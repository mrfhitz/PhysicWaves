PhysicWaves
===========
I made this program while study in [ISEP](http://www.isep.ipp.pt) College. 
At that time i was really interested in game dev and engine creation... So this Project show you some physic law's and some calculos.
On the code you can see that i build one core and one engine to run this project like a game.

*Please don't judge my skills. I was a noob at that time.*
